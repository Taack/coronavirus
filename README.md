Coronavirus Simulation

# Hypothesis

* Number of infected >> Number of dead people ;
* 2,5 Days to double infected population
* 10 days to suffer from infection (+/- 5 Days)
* Lethality of 0.002

# Usage

`source("~/github/coronavirus/rstudio/italy.r", chdir = T)`

# Simulation Results (as of 2020 / 03 / 20)

## Italy

* The number of simulated death should be 14272 +/- 2550
* The peak of death per day date 2020 / 03 / 25.2

## Spain

* The number of simulated death should be 9574 +/- 1978
* The peak of death per day date 2020 / 03 / 30.7

# Simulation Results (as of 2020 / 03 / 21)

## Spain (add 1378)

* The number of simulated death should be 14136 +/- 2190
* The peak of death per day date 2020 / 03 / 31.1
